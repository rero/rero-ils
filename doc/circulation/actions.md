# TODO

* evaluate if we need to extend invenio-circulation or do it in RERO ILS
* is item status always determined by loans in state charts or can we set it abitrary
* NPR: important simplifications are possible if an item with pending loan is always IN_TRANSIT_FOR_PICKUP, instead of being sometimes IN_TRANSIT_TO_HOUSE:
    * __CHECKIN_5__: point 2 of "Checkin"
    * __CANCEL_REQUEST_5__: point 2.2 of "Cancel request"
    * __REQUEST_TO_FIRST_RANK_5__: point 2.2 of "Move request to first priority"
    * __ADD_REQUEST_5__: point 1 of "Add a request"
    * __CHANGE_PICKUP_LOCATION_5__: point 5 of "Change request pickup location"

# NOTES

* :100: means that the action is already implemented in the backend
* :white_check_mark: means the action appeared in one scenario.

## Suggestions

In order to be less verbose, it would be great to use icon instead of long sentence as "pending loan exists and pickup library should be different from transaction library". It could be: :books: + :truck::house::no_entry_sign::dollar::house:

To simplify conditions about each case, we suggest some icons:

* :books: a loan exist (i.e PENDING loan exists).
* :no_entry_sign: means "**NOT**". I.e :no_entry_sign: :books: means loan does not exist (NOT loan). Used with another icon, it means "**different**". I.e :truck::house::no_entry_sign::dollar::house: means "pickup library is different from transaction library"
* :no_entry_sign: :books: loan does not exist
* :busts_in_silhouette: same patron as current loan patron
* :no_entry_sign: :busts_in_silhouette: means patron is different from current loan patron
* icons used to create complex word:
    * :house: library
    * :truck: pickup
    * :notebook: item
    * :triangular_flag_on_post: location
* as:
    * :truck::house: pickup library
    * :truck::triangular_flag_on_post: pickup location
    * :dollar::house: transaction library
