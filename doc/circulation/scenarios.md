Librarian B tries again to check it out for patron B (-> denied), then for patron A (-> ok). Patron A tries to renew item A (-> denied). Patron A returns item A at library B. The item is at desk for patron B.

Patron A requests it again, with pickup library A. Unexpectedly, libarian A tries to check out item A for patron A (-> denied). He then checks it out for patron B. Patron B returns item A at library C. It goes in transit to library A for patron A.

Before arriving to library A, it transits through library B. Patron A cancels his request. Item A transits through library C. It is then received at its owning library A.
