    """Task to update related loans if library calendar changes.

    If a library calendar changes, we will ensure that pending loans end_dates
    are still coherent with this calendar. If the end_date is now detected as
    a closed library date, the end_date of the loan will be updated to the
    next opening day of the library.

    ..notes..
       we only check about 'closed date' changes into the library calendar. In
       case of new opening day/date is set, pending loan end_date shouldn't be
       "down dated" (it will cause more problems with possible already sent
       notification).
       Example :
        * Patron receive a notification at Monday telling that
          the return date is Wednesday (because Tuesday is closed).
        * Next we edit the calendar to set all tuesday as opening day. In this
          use case the loan end_date will set to "Tuesday" (or maybe is already
          overdue if the loan is for multiple weeks).
        * Patron checkouts the book on Wednesday (as mentioned in received
          notification) but a fee will be possibly created.
