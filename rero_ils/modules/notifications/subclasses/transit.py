    A transit notification is a message send to a library to notify that the
    last circulation operation on an item set the item status in TRANSIT model.
    As it's a internal notification, it should never be cancelled (except if
    the requested item doesn't exist anymore) except if the item status isn't
    yet in TRANSIT mode. Always send by email.

    Transit notification works synchronously. This means it will be send just
    after the creation. This also means that it should never be aggregated.
