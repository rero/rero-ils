class UniqueFieldsExtension(RecordExtension):
    """Extension to check the uniqueness of fields value.

    CONCEPT:
        For some resources, we would to ensure that some values are unique.
        By example, two libraries can't have the same name into the same
        organisation.

        To allow to check, we will check into an ElasticSearch index based
        on some fields define into extension configuration.

    USAGE:
        Into the resource class, add this extension into the `_extensions`
        class attribute. This extension require 2 parameters :
          * a list of tuple. Each tuple could provide 2 data :
            - the record attribute to check (required).
            - the corresponding field into ES index (optional).
            if no ES field is provided, the same key should be used to search
            into ES.
          * the search class allowing to search into the ES index.

    EXAMPLE:
        _extensions = UniqueFieldsExtension(
          [('name',), ('number', 'number_sort')],
          IlsRecordsSearchChildClass
        )

    NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
        Avoid to use search on ES `text` analyzed field. It will generate
        strange result (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/
        reference/current/query-dsl-term-query.html#avoid-term-query-text-
        fields). Use a ES `keyword` analyzed field.
