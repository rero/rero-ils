Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``rero-ils`` for local development.

1. Fork the ``rero/rero-ils`` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/rero-ils.git

3. Install your local using the `installation procedure`_.

4. Create a branch for local development:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass tests:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ./run-tests.sh

   The tests will provide you with test coverage and also check PEP8
   (code style), PEP257 (documentation), flake8 as well as build the Sphinx
   documentation and run doctests.

6. Add the ``.gitmessage.txt`` file to your ``git`` configuration:

   .. code-block:: console

        # globally
        $ git config --global commit.template /path/.gitmessage.txt

        # locally
        $ git config --local commit.template .gitmessage.txt

   The ``Signed-off-by`` message is not used anymore, so you can avoid ``-s``
   parameters when committing. But of course, you can modify your own version
   of the ``.gitcommit.txt`` in order to add you own ``Co-Authored-by`` message.

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git add .
      $ git commit -s
      $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests and must not decrease test coverage.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/rero/rero-ils/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
