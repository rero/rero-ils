Contributing Guide
==================

The ``reroils`` project is basically an ILS flavor of Invenio_, so the first
question you would need to ask yourself is to which project you'd like to
contribute.

Either way, you'll find useful information on the `Invenio's contributing guide`_
and the `Invenio's developer guide`_.

If you need to contact the ``reroils`` developers team, there's a public
`gitter room`_.  You'll need a GitHub's account, or a
Twitter's account.

To signal bugs or to suggest improvements, please open a `new issue`_.

To improve the translation or to propose a new language, use the Transifex_
project.
