# This file is an example of what an RERO ILS production environment would look like.
# Here you can find a HAProxy load balancer which redirects the traffic to the web frontend, based on nginx.
# UI application and REST API are separate.
# There are also a celery worker backend, which can be monitored using Flower, and basics services such as
# a Redis cache, a database, a message broker (RabbitMQ) and ElasticSearch.
