RERO-ILS Installation
=====================

Services
--------

This environment makes use of different services. In most of the cases, RERO is an organisation and a ``reroadmin`` user exists. As long as users can be defined as administrator, the account ``reroadmin`` won't be used, except if needed.

The services are:

- GitHub_
- Travis_
- Docker_
- npm_
- Gitter_
- Transifex_
- PyPI [TODO]

Requirements
------------

- ``git``
- ``docker``, ``docker-compose``
- ``python``, ``pip``, ``pyenv``
- ``poetry``

Installation
------------

First, create your working directory and ``cd`` into it. Clone the project into this directory:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/rero/rero-ils.git

You need to install `poetry`, it will handle the virtual environment creation for the project
in order to sandbox our Python environment, as well as manage the dependency installation,
among other things.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pyenv install 3.9.7
    $ cd rero-ils
    $ pyenv local 3.9.7
    $ sudo pip install poetry

Next, ``cd`` into the project directory and bootstrap the instance (this will install
all Python dependencies and build all static assets):

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd rero-ils
    $ poetry run ./scripts/bootstrap

Start all dependent services using docker-compose (this will start PostgreSQL,
Elasticsearch 6, RabbitMQ and Redis):

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose up -d


Make sure you have `enough virtual memory
<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode>`_
for Elasticsearch in Docker:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Linux
    $ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

    # macOS
    $ screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty
    <enter>
    linut00001:~# sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144


Next, create database tables, search indexes and message queues:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run poe setup

Running
-------
Start the webserver and the celery worker:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run poe server

Start a Python shell:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run poe console

Upgrading
---------
In order to upgrade an existing instance simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run poe update

Testing
-------
Run the test suite via the provided script:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run poe run_tests

By default, end-to-end tests are skipped. You can include the E2E tests like
this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ env E2E=yes poetry run poe run_tests

For more information about end-to-end testing see `pytest-invenio
<https://pytest-invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#running-e2e-tests>`_.

Documentation
-------------
You can build the documentation with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run build_sphinx

Production environment
----------------------
You can use simulate a full production environment using the
``docker-compose.full.yml``. You can start it like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker build --rm -t rero/rero-ils-base:latest -f Dockerfile.base .
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d

In addition to the normal ``docker-compose.yml``, this one will start:

- HAProxy (load balancer)
- Nginx (web frontend)
- UWSGI (application container)
- Celery (background task worker)
- Celery (background task beat)
- Flower (Celery monitoring)
