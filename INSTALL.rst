RERO-ILS Installation
=====================

Services
--------

This environment makes use of different services. In most of the cases, RERO is an organisation and a ``reroadmin`` user exists. As long as users can be defined as administrator, the account ``reroadmin`` won't be used, except if needed.

The services are:

- GitHub_
- Travis_
- Docker_
- npm_
- Gitter_
- Transifex_
- PyPI [TODO]

Requirements
------------

- ``git``
- ``docker``, ``docker-compose``
- ``python``, ``pip``, ``pyenv``
- ``pipenv``

Installation
------------

First you need to install
`pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/install/#installing-pipenv>`_, it will handle
the virtual environment creation for the project in order to sandbox our Python
environment, as well as manage the dependency installation, among other things.

Create your working directory and ``cd`` into it. Clone inside this directory the project:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/rero/rero-ils.git

Next, ``cd`` into the project directory and bootstrap the instance (this will install
all Python dependencies and build all static assets):

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd rero-ils
    $ pipenv run bootstrap

Start all dependent services using docker-compose (this will start PostgreSQL,
Elasticsearch 6, RabbitMQ and Redis):

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose up -d


Make sure you have `enough virtual memory
<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode>`_
for Elasticsearch in Docker:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Linux
    $ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

    # macOS
    $ screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty
    <enter>
    linut00001:~# sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144


Next, create database tables, search indexes and message queues:

.. code-block:: console

    $ PIPENV_QUIET=1 pipenv run setup

Running
-------
Start the webserver and the celery worker:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv run server

Start a Python shell:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv run console

Upgrading
---------
In order to upgrade an existing instance simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv run update

Testing
-------
Run the test suite via the provided script:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./run-tests.sh

By default, end-to-end tests are skipped. You can include the E2E tests like
this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ env E2E=yes ./run-tests.sh

For more information about end-to-end testing see `pytest-invenio
<https://pytest-invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#running-e2e-tests>`_.

Documentation
-------------
You can build the documentation with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv run build_sphinx

Production environment
----------------------
You can use simulate a full production environment using the
``docker-compose.full.yml``. You can start it like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker build --rm -t rero/rero-ils-base:latest -f Dockerfile.base .
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d

In addition to the normal ``docker-compose.yml``, this one will start:

- HAProxy (load balancer)
- Nginx (web frontend)
- UWSGI (application container)
- Celery (background task worker)
- Celery (background task beat)
- Flower (Celery monitoring)
