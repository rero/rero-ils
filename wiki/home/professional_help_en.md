## To switch from public to professional interface

Once logged in through the *My account* menu, the user has a new menu entry in the user menu: *Professional interface*. A right-clic on this entry to open the professional interface in a new browser tab is allowed.

From the professional interface, to go back to the public interface, the opposite entry in the same menu is available: *Public interface*.
